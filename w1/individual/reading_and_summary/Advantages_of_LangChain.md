# Advantages of LangChain

## 1. Connect LLMs to our own data
Recently, there are many use cases in LLMs. However, LLMs may generate answers that do not meet our expectations in some use cases. As a result, we can solve this problem by using LangChain to connect LLMs to our own data. Therefore, LLMs could do referencing from our data.

## 2. Combine LLMs on doing different tasks in one use case
For example, we can use GPT-4 to interpret our queries in a specific case and use Claud-3 to response to those queries. By combining two LLMs in different needs, we could have a better model in some use cases.

## 3. Split the text to suitable length
As we known, LLMs usually have limited imput token length. LangChain allows us to split a long document into different sections and input to LLMs. Moreover, LLMs can recognize patterns in the texts. Therefore, text-splitting is very efficient.


## 4. Control the format of LLM responses
We can provide an example format for the responses we want from LLMs, including specifying the structure, tone, and content. This is known as prompt engineering.

## 5. Rich public resources
There are many open-source documents and videos about LangChain concepts and use cases. We could easily access these resources and hands-on learn how to use LangChain.
